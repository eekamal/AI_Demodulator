During  the  deep  space  exploration  of  the  solar  system,  the  reliable  communication  link  is  vital,  since  it  is  the  only way that enables the transmission of telecommand from the earth and the return of telemetry information and  scientific  data  from  the  probe.  However,  the  communication  link  in  the  solar  system  space  environment  faces many severe challenges. In addition, due to the ultralong communication distance, the communication link between  the  Earth  and  the  solar  system  probe  may  encounter  solar  scintillation  due  to  solar  wind  during  near  superior solar conjunction
